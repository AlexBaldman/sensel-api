# Sensel API

The Sensel API allows users to communicate with Sensel devices. 

## Getting Started

To run the examples, first install the Sensel libraries found in sensel-install. After installing the libraries, you can open one of the Sensel source examples (currently C, Python and C&#35;). 

The source for the main Sensel library can be found in sensel-lib. This includes all of the necessary functions to communicate with Sensel devices except for force frame decompression. More information can be found below.
